They are discussed briefly below</span> </p><p> <span style="background: #FFCAD7">Baseline wander is a low-frequency noise of around 0.5 to 0.6 Hz. To remove it, a high-pass filter of cut-off frequency 0.5 to 0.6 Hz can be used. Powerline interference (50 or 60 Hz noise from mains supply) can be removed by using a notch filter of 50 or 60 Hz cut-off frequency. EMG noise is a high frequency noise of above 100 Hz and hence may be removed by a low-pass filter of an appropriate cut-off frequency. Electrode motion artifacts can be suppressed by minimizing the movements made by the subject</span> </p><p> <span style="background: #FFCAD7">However,  increased  movement  of  the  body  during  exercise   or   stress   test   increase   the   frequency   content   of   baseline  wander.</span> </p><p> <span style="background: #D1FF61">ince  the  baseline  signal  is  a  low  frequency  signal therefore Finite Impulse Response (FIR) high-pass zero phase  forward-backward  filtering  with  a  cut-off  frequency  of  0.5 Hz to estimate and remove the baseline in the ECG signal can be used</span> </p><p> <span style="background: #FFCAD7">It is necessary to remove powerline interference from  ECG  signals  as  it  completely  superimposes  the  low frequency ECG waves like P wave and T wave</span> </p><p> <span style="background: #FFCAD7">Since  the  ECG  is  a  repetitive  signal,  techniques  can  be  used  to  reduce  muscle  noise  in  a  way  similar  to  the  processing  of  evoked  potentials.</span> </p><p> <span style="background: #FFCAD7">semble  averaging  is,  however,  restricted  to  one  particular  QRS  morphology  at  a  time  and  requires  that  several  beats  be  available</span> </p><p> <span style="background: #FFCAD7">In the  ECG,  these  artifacts  are  manifested  as  large-amplitude  waveforms which are sometimes mistaken for QRS complexes</span> </p><p> <span style="background: #FFCAD7">2.1 Techniques for Removal of Baseline Wander</span> </p><p> <span style="background: #FFCAD7">the ideal high-pass filter as a starting point</span> </p><p> <span style="background: #FFCAD7">Where, 2cfπ= 2cfπ  and sff= sff.

For  example,  if  the  sampling  frequency  is 250 Hz, then 125 Hz will be the cut-off frequency for both LPF and HPF in the first level decomposition. In second level decomposition,  the  cut-off  frequency  becomes  62.5  Hz,  for  third  level  decomposition  it  becomes  31.25  Hz  and  so  on</span> </p><p> <span style="background: #FFCAD7">2.2 Techniques for Removal of Powerline Interference</span> </p><p> <span style="background: #FFCAD7">Matlab  code  to  remove  powerline  interference  from  ECG signal</span> </p><p> <span style="background: #FFCAD7">two IIR notch filters: one for removing the baseline wander with a notch concentrated at 0.67 Hz and another for removing the powerline interference with a notch concentrated at 60 Hz</span> </p><p> <span style="background: #FFCAD7">Details  of  designing  the  width  function()nβ,  truncating  h  (k, n) in (15), and the resulting performance on ECG signals can be found in [5].

There are certainly other options available, these are the 3 most common, and the 3 that popped into my head. When using a reverse proxy, I highly recommend setting up some form of authentication. The most common (and easiest to setup) is basic authentication (i.e. username/password). In this case, I also highly recommend the use of rate limiting to prevent brute-force password guessing attacks. A more secure choice would be client-certificate authentication, this of course requires setting up a PKI to handle the issuance and revocation of certificates.<br><br>Whether you use a reverse proxy, or VPN to access OctoPrint; I recommend putting it on a separate physical box to the box connected to your printer.
